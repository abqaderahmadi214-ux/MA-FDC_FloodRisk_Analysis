# MA-FDC Flood Risk Analysis

This repository contains R scripts, figures, and a short summary related to my MSc thesis on Mean Annual Flow Duration Curves (MA-FDCs) and hydrological basin classification using the CAMELS-US dataset.

The work focuses on extracting hydrological signatures, clustering river basins, and visualizing flow regime behavior, with applications to flood risk analysis and regionalization in data-scarce catchments.

## Contents
- R scripts for data processing, MA-FDC construction, and clustering
- Example figures (MA-FDCs, PCA, basin maps)
- One-page thesis summary

## Tools
- R (time-series analysis, clustering, PCA, visualization)
